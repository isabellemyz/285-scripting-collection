Sundown and all the damage done
by Ada Limon

Nearly nine and still the sun’s not slunk
into its nightly digs. The burnt meat smell
of mid-week cookouts and wet grass
hangs in the air like loose familiar summer
garb. Standing by the magnolia tree, I think
if I were to live as long as she did, I’d have
eleven more years. And if I were to live as long
as him, I’d have forty-nine. As long as him,
I’d be dead already. As long as her, this
would be my final year. There’s a strange
contentment to this countdown, a nodding
to this time, where I get to stand under
the waxy leaves of the ancient genus, a tree
that appeared before even the bees, and
watch as fireflies land on the tough tepals
until each broad flower glows like a torch-lit
mausoleum. They call the beetle’s conspicuous
bioluminescence “a cold light,” but why then,
do I still feel so much fire?
