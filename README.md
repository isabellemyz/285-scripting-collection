# 285-scripting-collection
Collection of short scripts and projects for CSDS 285. Each of the projects in this repo are explained below!

### ATLA game
The user can play a fun game set in the TV show *Avatar: The Last Airbender*. The game resembles rock-paper-scissors, except the options are the four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. The winning hierarchy is determined by the Avatar Cycle: water > earth > fire > air > water... and so on.

The user can choose to play indefinitely or set a certain number of rounds in which they try to beat the computer.

### de-stress page
This page features a "bubble popper" - the user can click on a square to "pop" it and also change the color or reset the grid.

### question formatter
This page is specifically for Professor Loui's assignments for CSDS 285. It allows me to copy-paste his questions from Canvas and format them to my liking.
