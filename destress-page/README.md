## BUBBLE POP PROGRESS LOG

I finished this project before I made the repo, so the version history does not accurately reflect on how I worked on it. I have roughly documented my progress below.

#### DRAFT 1
- Make header and blurb
- Generate plain black boxes
- Figure out how to show "pop" when a box is clicked

#### DRAFT 2
- Make reset bubbles option
- Figure out how to change the color of all boxes
- Add color option for user input

#### DRAFT 3
- Fix up small things such as:
  - Have reset button change all boxes to black and show all boxes
  - Have change color option not reset the boxes
