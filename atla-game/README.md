## ATLA GAME LOG

I completed this project before I made this repo, so version history is not accurate to how I worked on it. I have roughly documented my process below.

#### DRAFT 1
- Made title and typed up blurb
- Figured out how to split the page into two separate sections
- Made headings for player and computer sections
- Added and formatted buttons (outline, images, color)

#### DRAFT 2
- Added "opponent picking..." to the top
- Figured out how to determine and briefly display round winner
- Added reset game button

At this point, you could play the game an endless amount of times.

#### DRAFT 3
- Added score heading to keep track of scores
- Added rounds functionality that allows user to specify number of rounds to play to

#### DRAFT 4
- Added more small things for user experience like:
  - Briefly changing the score to red when it's updated
  - Making notifications like "you win" or "you lose" red
  - Displaying number of rounds left (if the user entered any to begin with)
